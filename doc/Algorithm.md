This Python script contains an `Algorithm` class which is used for the generation of a graph based on various parameters.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Numpy
- Random
- Tools module (local)

## Imports

- `random`: Python module for generating random numbers.
- `numpy`: Python module for numerical computations.
- `tools`: Local module containing various utility functions.

## Classes

### Algorithm

This is the main class in the script, which is used to generate the graph based on a specified algorithm.

- **Attributes:**
    
    - `iterations`: The number of iterations the algorithm has undergone.
    - `stop_algorithm`: A boolean flag to indicate whether the algorithm should be stopped.
    - `min_nodes`: The minimum number of nodes for the graph.
    - `loop_closure_probability`: The probability of loop closure in the graph.
- **Methods:**
    
    - `__init__(min_nodes_p = 4, loop_closure_probability_p = 10)`: Initializes the class with the provided or default parameters.
    - `probabilistic(graph_p, nb_iterations)`: Generates a graph based on the inverse of Manhattan distance, given a certain number of iterations or until all nodes are deactivated.
    - `loop_closure(graph_p)`: Post-processing function to create loop closure in the graph.
    - `voronoi`: Placeholder method for implementing a Voronoi algorithm.
    - `lattice_fibo`: Placeholder method for implementing a Lattice Fibonacci algorithm.
    - `node_manhattan_distance(node1, node2)`: Calculates the Manhattan distance between two nodes.
    - `manhattan_distance(coord1, coord2)`: Calculates the Manhattan distance between two coordinates.
    - `calculate_right_graph_coordinates(parent_node_p, grid_coordinates_p)`: Returns the coordinates of the child node on the graph based on the parent coordinates and the new child coordinates.

## Execution

The script itself is not intended for standalone execution. Rather, the `Algorithm` class would be instantiated in another script, and its methods would be called as required to generate a graph.

The `probabilistic` method is the core of the graph generation process, generating nodes based on the inverse of the Manhattan distance between them. This method deactivates nodes after a certain threshold is reached and can be stopped prematurely if all nodes are deactivated.

The `loop_closure` method adds extra edges to the graph in a post-processing step, with the aim of closing loops in the graph.

The `node_manhattan_distance` and `manhattan_distance` methods are utility functions for calculating distances between nodes or coordinates, respectively, using the Manhattan (city block) metric.

The `calculate_right_graph_coordinates` is a utility function to calculate the coordinates of a new node in the graph based on the coordinates of its parent node and its own grid coordinates.
